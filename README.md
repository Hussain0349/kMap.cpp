# Karnaugh Map (K-Map) Solver
## **Overview**
This project is a Karnaugh Map (K-Map) Solver implemented in C++. It allows users to simplify Boolean expressions using Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) forms. The tool takes user inputs for minterms or maxterms, processes them, and visually represents the K-Map in a 4x4 grid. Additionally, it outputs the simplified Boolean expression based on the provided inputs.
### Features
**Sum of Products (SOP) Mode:** Users can input minterms, which are processed to create a Boolean expression in SOP form. \
**Product of Sums (POS) Mode:** Users can input maxterms, which are processed to generate a Boolean expression in POS form. \
**K-Map Visualization:** The program displays a 4x4 K-Map grid with the user inputs. \
**Boolean Expression Output:** Based on the K-Map, the program provides a simplified Boolean expression for both SOP and POS. \
